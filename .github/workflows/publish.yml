name: Publish to pub.dev

# How to release a new version:
# 1. Bump all pubspec.yaml versions and the changelogs
# 2. Push a new tag (e.g. "git tag v1.2.3 && git push origin v1.2.3")
# 3. The "publish" jobs will automatically publish the package to pub.dev
# 4. The "release" job will automatically create a release draft on GitHub

    tags:
